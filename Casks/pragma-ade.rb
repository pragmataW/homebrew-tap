  caveats <<~EOS
    Pragma ADE is not signed with an Apple Developer ID or notarized.
    The cask removes the quarantine flag after install. If macOS still blocks it, run:
      xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "#{appdir}/Pragma ADE.app"

    Pragma ADE drives the agent CLIs already on your machine: install Claude Code
    and/or OpenCode 2.x, and git, separately.
